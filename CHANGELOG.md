### Added

- **Core server** — Native Swift MCP server using stdio transport (MCP protocol `2025-11-25`)
- **OmniFocus bridge** — Omni Automation JavaScript via `osascript` subprocess with TCC-safe permission handling
- **Capability detection** — Automatic Pro vs Standard mode detection at startup

#### Read Tools (Pro required)
- `diagnostics` — Server health, connection status, capability mode, cache stats
- `list_inbox` — Inbox tasks with pagination and field projection
- `list_today` — Tasks due or deferred until today
- `list_flagged` — Flagged incomplete tasks
- `list_forecast` — Overdue + due today + flagged, sorted by due date
- `list_projects` — Projects with status filter (active, on_hold, completed, dropped, all)
- `list_tags` — All tags with optional task count
- `list_perspectives` — All built-in and custom perspectives
- `get_perspective_tasks` — Tasks from any perspective via Window content tree API
- `get_task_by_id` — Single task lookup by stable OmniFocus ID
- `search_tasks` — Filtered search with AND logic (text, project, tag, status, date range, flagged)
- `get_task_count` — Count matching tasks without returning data

#### Mutation Tools (Pro required)
- `create_task` — Create tasks in inbox or specific project with tags, dates, and flags
- `update_task` — Patch-based updates with dry-run default and HMAC-SHA256 confirm-token for irreversible transitions (complete, drop)

- **Configuration** — Environment variables (`OMNIFOCUS_MCP_*`) and optional config file (`~/.config/omnifocus-mcp/config.json`)
